  <h2>A Special Friend: Bela</h2>
  <small>Posted on September 27, 2025 by Sumon Ray</small>

    I was fortunate to meet Bela last year at Khulna University. While I studied in the 
    Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, Bela pursued Mass Communication 
    and Journalism. Even though our fields were different, we quickly became good friends. 
  </p>

  <p>
    During one of the most difficult phases of my life, when I was struggling with mental 
    health problems, Bela stood beside me like a true friend. His support, understanding, 
    and encouragement helped me overcome that tough time.

    I am very, very thankful to Bela. Sometimes we donâ€™t realize how important someone 
    becomes in our lives until they make a real difference. Bela has been that kind of 
    friend for me, and I will always remain grateful.
